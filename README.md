PushButton Arduino Library
--------------------------

Library for Arduino to use PushButton.
- Detects two types of user press: short press and long press (>1s);
- Filters hw button noises by software;

Initially developed to Joystick Module but can be used for any button that, when pressed, connect a digital pin of arduino to a GND. 
This button do not need a external pull up resistor because this library use the internal pull up resistor of Arduino digital pins.
